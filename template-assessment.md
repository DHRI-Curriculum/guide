# Assessment

## Quantitative Self-Assessment

Add each question as a regular paragraph.

- Each question should have multiple choice answers, added as bullet points under the paragraph.
- Make sure that the questions enable the learner to evaluate their understanding of specific concepts from the workshop.

## Qualitative Self-Assessment

Add each question as a regular paragraph. These qualitative questions (of course) do not need to have answers but should enable the learner to think about what they learned and how it can be used.

- If you think of readings/tutorials/projects/challenges from the "Theory to Practice" section to direct them to, and add a note of that as a bullet point under relevant questions.
